🧠 Mental Health Chatbot using Python & Streamlit

This project is an AI-powered Mental Health Chatbot developed using Python with Streamlit as the user interface. The chatbot is designed to provide a supportive, interactive, and user-friendly environment where users can communicate their thoughts and emotions and receive empathetic, AI-generated responses.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how artificial intelligence and natural language processing can be combined with a simple web-based interface to create an accessible mental health support system. The chatbot listens to user input, processes it using AI techniques, and responds in a thoughtful and conversational manner, encouraging positive engagement and emotional expression.

Streamlit is used to build a clean and intuitive user interface that allows real-time interaction without requiring complex frontend development. The application can be run locally or deployed online, making it suitable for academic projects, demonstrations, and portfolio presentation.

This project emphasizes ease of use, responsiveness, and clarity. It is structured in a modular way so that additional features, improved AI models, or external APIs can be integrated easily in the future. The chatbot does not store personal data, focusing instead on providing immediate conversational support.
